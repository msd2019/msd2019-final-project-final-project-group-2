Preston Bradham (PMB2164), Chaim Eisenbach (CE2388), Aysha Khan (ASK2256)

This repository has code to attempt to replicate and extend the results in Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War by James D. Fearon & David D. Laitin, American Political Science Review.

A complete report of our results is in `05_final_report.pdf`, which can be generated by cloning this repository and running `make` to execute the commands in the `Makefile` file. All data are in `data/` and any original source code provided by the authors is in `authors_original_code/`.

The repository is structured as follows:

1. `01_get_original_data.sh` gets the original data used by the authors and places a copy in `data/`
2. `02_clean_original_data.sh` cleans this data and saves the relevant dataframe(s) in `data/original_data_clean.Rdata`
5. `05_final_report.Rmd` analysis both the original and new data to replicate and extend the results of the original paper, and produces the final report `05_final_report.pdf`
